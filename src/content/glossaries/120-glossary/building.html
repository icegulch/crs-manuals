title: Building
---

For CRS purposes, the definition of what constitutes a building is based on whether the structure is insurable. It must meet the following criteria, which are taken from the definition in the National Flood Insurance Program’s Flood Insurance Manual for insurance agents. A “building” is

<blockquote>
  <p>
    A structure with two or more outside rigid walls and a fully secured roof, that is affixed to a permanent site; or
  </p>

  <p>
    A manufactured home (a “manufactured home,” also known as a mobile home, is a structure built on a permanent chassis, transported to its site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation); or
  </p>

  <p>
    A travel trailer without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is regulated under the community’s floodplain management and building ordinances or laws.
  </p>

  <p>
    “Building” does not mean a gas or liquid storage tank or a recreational vehicle, a park trailer, or other similar vehicle, except as described above.
