title: Coastal A Zone
---

Those parts of a community’s coastal floodplain that are subject to waves
with heights of between 1.5 and 3 feet during a 1% annual chance storm. The exact
boundary of a Coastal A Zone is determined by the community, as described in
Section 432.k, although the Federal Emergency Management Agency may provide a
proposed boundary or “limit of moderate wave action” (LiMWA) on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps.
