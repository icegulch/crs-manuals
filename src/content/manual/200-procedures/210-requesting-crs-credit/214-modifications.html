<p>
  A community may modify its CRS classification by applying for credit for new
  elements or activities, dropping one or more elements or activities, or
  submitting revised versions of materials.
</p>

<h3>214.a. Modification Criteria</h3>

<p>
  Modifications are processed and verified in the same manner as cycle
  verification visits, although a visit may not be necessary if everything can
  be verified remotely.
</p>

<p>The following provisions apply to modifications.</p>

<ol class="paren-numlist">
  <li>
    A cover letter and the documentation needed for the credit are submitted to
    the ISO/CRS Specialist.
  </li>
  <li>
    The community must use the credit criteria of the
    <i>Coordinator’s Manual</i> in effect at the time the modification is
    submitted.
  </li>
  <li>
    A community’s CRS classification cannot change more than once a year.
    Therefore, only one modification can be processed over a 12-month period.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a community is modifying an activity previously applied for, its
    submittal must include documentation for both the new elements of the
    activity and those that were previously credited, if they are still being
    implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ISO/CRS Specialist verifies only the activity(ies) being modified and
    reviews the rest at the next cycle verification visit. There are two
    exceptions to this, as noted under (6) and (7), below.
  </li>
  <li>
    The ISO/CRS Specialist will automatically update the community’s credit
    points for
    <ol>
      <li>
        The community’s BCEGS classification (a Class 6 and Class 4 prerequisite
        and credited in Section 432(h));
      </li>
      <li>
        The community’s credit for the state dam safety credit (Section 632.a);
        and
      </li>
      <li>
        The county growth adjustment (Section 710). If the growth adjustment is
        changed, the total points for all affected activities in the 400 series
        will reflect the new factor.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the community’s repetitive loss category has changed since the
        previous cycle verification, the community must comply with Section
        502.a, as applicable.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    The community’s entire program is verified with a verification visit under
    the following circumstances:
    <ol>
      <li>If the modification will result in a two-class improvement, or</li>
      <li>
        If the <i>Coordinator’s Manual</i> has substantially changed most of the
        rest of the community’s credits.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  In these situations, the verification visit counts as a cycle verification
  visit and the community’s cycle schedule starts over.
</p>

<h3>214.b. Courtesy Reviews</h3>

<p>
  Communities are encouraged to submit materials at any time for the ISO/CRS
  Specialist to review. A courtesy review advises the community about the impact
  of new programs or revisions to existing activities on its CRS credit.
</p>

<p>
  Courtesy review materials are returned to the community with comments. They
  are not credited to the community’s program. The only way a community’s credit
  points may be changed is by submitting a modification with enough points to
  result in a class change.
</p>

<p>
  If the community submits a modification that does not have sufficient credit
  points to result in a class change, it is treated as material for a courtesy
  review.
