  The Community Rating System (CRS) credits local activities that advise people about the flood
  hazard, flood insurance, and flood protection measures. The activities can be directed toward
  floodplain residents, property owners, insurance agents, real estate agents, or other segments of the
  local populace. One activity, <strong>310 (Elevation Certificates)</strong>, is mandatory for CRS classification.
