<p>The maximum credit for this element is 48 points.</p>

<p>ECPO credit is provided if completed and correct certificates are maintained for all buildings built or substantially
  improved in the SFHA between the date of the effective FIRM at the time of construction and the date of the
  community’s application to the Community Rating System.</p>

<p>If there are no post-FIRM buildings in the SFHA, the community receives full credit for ECPO because there are no
  post-FIRM buildings or substantial improvements without Elevation Certificates. The CRS would prefer to see no
  buildings in the floodplain rather than provide credit for records on those that have been built. However, if the
  community annexes lands that include buildings in the SFHA constructed since the date of its initial FIRM, the credit
  is based on how many of those buildings have Elevation Certificates.</p>

  <ol class="paren-numlist">
    <li>The community must maintain all required construction certificates described in Section 301.b for all buildings in
      the SFHA that have been newly constructed, substantially improved, or reconstructed due to substantial damage during
      the period credited. “Buildings” are defined in Section 302.a.</li>

    <li>The community must review the certificates to ensure that they are complete and that the information is correct,
      and make copies of the certificates readily available to anyone upon request, following the process described in the
      community’s construction certificate management procedures required in Section 312.a. See also Section 301.c,
      Construction Certificate Checklists and Section 301.d, Getting Correct Construction Certificates.</li>
