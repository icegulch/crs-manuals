  <h2 id="212a-title" class="h4">212.a. Application Request</h2>
  <p>
    Application for a CRS classification is voluntary. A community can request a classification at any time. A community can request a classification for any activities and elements, provided that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The credit points add up to at least 500 points, enough to become a Class 9; and
    </li>
    <li>
      The community can meet all of the Class 9 prerequisites (Section 211.a).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The following documentation is needed to request a classification. Both items can be submitted digitally to <a href="mailto:NFIPCRS@ISO.com">NFIPCRS@ISO.com</a> (letters needing signatures should be scanned and sent as PDF files).
  </p>
  <ol class="paren-numlist">
    <li>
      A letter of interest sent to the FEMA Regional Office that
      <ul>
        <li>
          States that the community is interested in joining the Community Rating System,
        </li>
        <li>
          Designates the community’s CRS Coordinator,
        </li>
        <li>
          States that the community will cooperate with the verification process, and
        </li>
        <li>
          States that the community understands that approval from the FEMA Regional Office is needed for the Contractor to visit the community and verify the creditable activities.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The letter is signed by the community’s CEO and is sent to the FEMA Regional Office. Copies of the letter are also sent to the State NFIP Coordinator and the Contractor. Example language can be obtained from the Contractor for the community’s area. An example letter is included in the “Community Rating System (CRS) Application Letter of Interest and CRS Quick Check,” available from the Contractor.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      Documentation showing that the community is implementing activities that warrant at least 500 points to be at least a Class 9. This can be done by using the CRS Quick Check, available www.fema.gov/community-rating-system, a state-specific equivalent recommended by the Contractor, or another method that shows each creditable element that the community can document as meeting the credit requirements.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    If the community’s submittal is complete and shows that 500 or more credit points are likely, the Contractor will contact the FEMA Regional Office for approval to conduct an initial verification visit with the community. This is the only approval for the Contractor to commence the application process. As described in Section 211.a (2), communities must meet the minimum standards of the NFIP as determined by a Community Assistance Visit conducted by FEMA within six months of the verification visit. Therefore, the Regional Office (or State NFIP Coordinator) may opt to conduct the Community Assistance Visit before giving approval for the verification visit.
  </p>
  <p>
    When approval is received, the Contractor will contact the community to schedule the initial verification visit. At the visit, the program is explained and each activity likely to receive credit is reviewed. The conduct of the verification visit is explained in Section 230.

  <h2 id="212b-title" class="h4">212.b. Application Documentation</h2>
  <p>
    The Contractor schedules the initial verification visit to review the community’s programs and activities. The Contractor collects the needed materials from community staff. Before the materials can be processed, the Contractor must have the following five items. Some of the documentation can be provided digitally.
  </p>
  <ol class="paren-numlist">
    <li>
      Correspondence from the FEMA Regional Office stating that the community is in full compliance with the minimum requirements of the NFIP (see Section 211.a(2)).
    </li>
    <li>
      The CRS Program Data Table, with lines 6 and 13 completed (see Figure 210-1). The CRS Program Data Table is the second page of the “CC-213 Recertification” form. For a community’s initial application to the program, only the second page of the CC-213 Recertification is required (page CC-213-2).
    </li>
    <li>
      Documentation for each element for which credit is desired. Sections 310–630 have documentation sections that itemize what is needed. The Contractor reviews these with the community during the visit and collects what is needed. Section 231 reviews how documentation should be provided by the community.
    </li>
    <li>
      A certification signed by the community’s CEO that says:
      <blockquote class="bg--primary-light p-3 mt-2">
        <p>
          “I hereby certify that ___________ [community name] is implementing the following activities (check the ones that apply). We will continue to implement these activities and will advise FEMA if any of them are not being conducted in accordance with this certification. We will cooperate with the Contractor’s verification visit and will submit the documentation and annual recertification needed to validate our program.”
        </p>
        <p>
          The certification is included in the “CC-230 Verification Certification” form, which is the verification cover page provided by the Contractor. The CRS Community Certifications are available at www.fema.gov/community-rating-system. Figure 230-1 shows a sample CC-231. The community may propose alternative language.
        </p>

    <li>
      A certification signed by the community’s CEO that says:
      <blockquote class="bg--primary-light p-3 mt-2">
        <p>
          “I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief, we are maintaining in force all flood insurance policies that have been required of us as a condition of federal financial assistance for insurable buildings owned by us and located in the Special Flood Hazard Area shown on our Flood Insurance Rate Map.”
        </p>
        <p>
          I further understand that disaster assistance for any community-owned building located in the Special Flood Hazard Area is reduced by the amount of NFIP flood insurance coverage (structural and contents) that a community should be carrying on the building, regardless of whether the community is carrying a policy.”
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The flood insurance prerequisite is explained in more detail in Figure 210-1. The certification is included in a cover sheet provided by the Contractor. This certification is also included in the “CC-230 Verification Certification” form. The community may propose alternative language.
