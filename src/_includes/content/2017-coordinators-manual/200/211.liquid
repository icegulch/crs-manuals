<p>A community must meet the current “Coordinator’s Manual’s” prerequisites at the time of each verification visit. An initial verification visit is conducted in response to a community’s request to join the Community Rating System. Subsequent visits are conducted every few years on a set schedule and are called “cycle verification visits.” Verification visits are explained in Section 230.</p>
<p>No new requirements, including annual recertification requirements, affect a participating CRS community until the Contractor reviews them at the cycle verification visit conducted with the community after the new criteria take effect.</p>

  <h2 id="211a-title" class="h4">211.a. Class 9 Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>In order to become and continue to be a Class 9 or better, a community must demonstrate that it has enough points to warrant the class and meet the following six prerequisites.</p>
  <ol class="paren-numlist">
    <li>The community must have been in the Regular Phase of the NFIP for at least one year.</li>
    <li>The community must be in full compliance with the minimum requirements of the NFIP. There must be correspondence from the Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) stating that the community is in full compliance with the NFIP. The correspondence must have been sent within six months of the initial CRS verification visit. The FEMA Regional Office or State NFIP Coordinator may need to conduct a Community Assistance Visit if neither has been in the community recently. If a community is determined at any time to be in less-than-full compliance, it will retrograde to a Class 10.</li>
    <li>The community must<ol>
    <li>Maintain all required floodplain-related construction certificates as described in Section 301.b for all buildings constructed, substantially improved, and/or reconstructed due to substantial damage in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SHFA) after the community applies for credit.</li>
    <li>Achieve 90% accuracy on its floodplain-related construction certificates during its annual review. This is explained in Section 301.e.</li>
    <li>Receive credit for construction certificate management procedures (element CCMP) under Activity 310 (Elevation Certificates).</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>If there are one or more repetitive loss properties in the community, the community must take certain actions as specified in Sections 501–504. These include reviewing and updating the list of repetitive loss properties, mapping repetitive loss areas, describing the causes of the losses, and sending an outreach project to those areas each year. A community with 50 or more repetitive loss properties (a “Category C” community) must also prepare a repetitive loss area analysis or floodplain management plan that addresses its repetitive flood problem.</p>
    <p>The community must maintain in force flood insurance policies for insurable buildings owned by the community and located in the SFHA shown on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The community’s chief executive officer (CEO) signs the verification visit cover sheet, which includes a statement that the signer certifies that the community has all the flood insurance policies that it has been required to maintain on properties owned by the community.</p>
    <p>Communities document that they have met the prerequisite when joining the CRS (by signing form CC-230) and again at annual recertification (with form CC-213). The CEO’s signature confirms the following:</p>
    <div class="border m-4 p-2">
      <p>“I hereby certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, we are maintaining in force flood insurance policies for insurable buildings owned by us and located in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) shown on our Flood Insurance Rate Map.</p>
      <p>I further understand that disaster assistance for any community-owned building located in the SFHA is reduced by the amount of National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) flood insurance coverage (structure and contents) that a community should be carrying on the building, regardless of whether the community is carrying a policy.”</p>
    </div>
    <p>Note that the flood insurance policies held on the insurable buildings owned by the community do not have to be NFIP policies.</p>
    <aside class="bg--primary-light p-3">
      <h3 class="h6">The CRS flood insurance prerequisite.</h3>
      <p>As part of the verification documentation, the community’s chief executive officer must certify that the community has all the flood insurance policies it has been required to have. The program is not concerned with past lapses in flood insurance coverage. Flood insurance must be in effect at the time of the verification visit and must be kept in the future. The CRS Coordinator should make every effort to determine the community’s legal requirement to purchase flood insurance.</p>
      <p>Congress has taken steps to encourage public agencies and private property owners to purchase flood insurance instead of relying exclusively on disaster assistance for help after a flood. Therefore, disaster assistance for a community-owned building will be reduced by the amount of NFIP flood insurance coverage (structure and contents) the community should be carrying on the building, regardless of whether the community is actually carrying a policy.</p>
      <p>In effect, disaster assistance for a public agency has a very large deductible equal to the flood insurance policy the agency should carry. The law expects public agencies to be appropriately insured as a condition of receiving federal disaster assistance.</p>
      <p>There have also been recent cases in which communities were underinsured. Some
      communities have purchased only the required amount of coverage (e.g., coverage equal to the amount of a previous federal grant). The disaster assistance rule requires that a flooddamaged community fund all repairs up to the amount of flood insurance that it could have purchased.</p>
      <p>Whether there was a requirement to purchase and maintain flood insurance as a condition of a previous federal grant or not, the community’s risk manager or other appropriate official should ensure that all community-owned buildings exposed to flooding are insured for flood damage. Some communities have found out too late that their all-risk insurance policies did not cover flooding.</p>
    </aside>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>If a coastal community receives a draft Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) that delineates the Limit of Moderate Wave Action (LiMWA), the community must agree to show the LiMWA on its final published FIRM. Although showing a LiMWA on a FIRM is voluntary for non-CRS communities, it is a prerequisite for participation in the program. The LiMWA delineation is for informational purposes only. There is no CRS requirement to regulate the area differently, but the series of International Codes has special construction requirements in areas subject to breaking waves of 1.5 feet or higher. Communities are encouraged to meet the criteria for Coastal A Zone credit (CAZ) in Activity 430 (Higher Regulatory Standards).</p>
      <p>County-wide FIRMs can show a LiMWA in one community but not in others. If a draft FIRM has been presented to a participating community with a LiMWA on it, the community must request that the LiMWA be shown on the final version, even if other communities do not want it shown in their corporate limits.</p>
      <p>If a final FIRM was published before the first verification visit after the “2013 Coordinator’s Manual” and it does not show a LiMWA, the LiMWA prerequisite only affects later revisions of the FIRM if FEMA provides one on a draft map. A community is not expected to request a change to a map already published.</p>

  <h2 id="211b-title" class="h4">211.b. Class 8 Prerequisites</h2>
  <ol class="paren-numlist">
    <li>
      The community must meet all the Class 9 prerequisites.
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The community must adopt and enforce at least a 1-foot freeboard requirement (including machinery or equipment) for all residential buildings constructed, substantially improved, and/or reconstructed due to substantial damage throughout its SFHA where base flood elevations have been determined on its currently effective FIRM or in its Flood Insurance Study (FIS), except those areas that receive open space credit under Activity 420 (Open Space Preservation).</p>
      <p>The Class 8 prerequisite can be met through the enforcement of local ordinances or building codes, and/or state building codes, provided the freeboard standard applies to all residential buildings, whether single-family, multi-family, or manufactured. This includes the replacement of manufactured homes in pre-FIRM manufactured home parks.</p>
      <p>The ordinance or building code must require that machinery or equipment be elevated to at least 1 foot above the base flood elevation for buildings newly constructed, substantially improved, and/or reconstructed due to substantial damage. This requirement includes machinery and equipment placed within attached garages and/or within enclosures below elevated buildings, with the exception of utility meters and equipment specifically designed to withstand inundation according to the standards of the International Residential Codes and the NFIP. The Class 8 freeboard prerequisite will be met provided that attached garages and enclosures below elevated buildings meet the minimum requirements of the NFIP (elevated to the base flood elevation or having proper openings).</p>
      <p>Communities that enforce an adopted freeboard standard that meets the Class 8 prerequisite will be provided with freeboard (element FRB) credit under Activity 430 (Higher Regulatory Standards). Credit will be evaluated at the next CRS verification visit or next modification.</p>
      <p>The one-foot-freeboard requirement applies to all AE Zones, all VE Zones, and all numbered AO and AH Zones. The requirement must be in effect at the time of the cycle visit or the community will not satisfy the requirement.</p>
      <p>An attached garage is not required to be constructed to the required freeboard elevation or wet floodproofed to that elevation.</p>
      <p>A community that has adopted and enforces ASCE-24 meets this prerequisite.</p>
      <p>Home heating oil or propane storage tanks are not required to be elevated, but must meet the minimum conditions of the NFIP.</p>

  <h2 id="211c-title" class="h4">211.c. Class 6 Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>In order to be a Class 6 or better, a community must demonstrate that it has enough points to warrant the class and meet the following two prerequisites.</p>
  <ol class="paren-numlist">
    <li>
      The community must meet all the Class 8 prerequisites.
    </li>
    <li>
      The community must have received and continue to maintain a classification of 5/5 or better under the Building Code Effectiveness Grading Schedule (BCEGS). Both BCEGS classifications (residential/personal and commercial) must be a class 5 or better. When communities submit a modification or undergo a cycle verification, they must meet the BCEGS prerequisite in order to achieve or remain a CRS Class 6 or better.
    </li>
    <li>
      The BCEGS program measures a community’s building code adoption and enforcement as they relate to natural hazards mitigation. Learn more about the BCEGS program. Credit is also provided for BCEGS classifications of 5/5 or better under the building code credit (BC) in Section 432.h.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>In accordance with Section 113.d, communities may propose alternative approaches to meet the objectives of a prerequisite. For example, communities that are prohibited by state law from adopting and enforcing building codes may submit comprehensive building construction regulations and administration and inspection procedures for review to determine the equivalent BCEGSclassification. Such regulations must be enforced throughout the community, not just in the floodplain.</p>

  <h2 id="211d-title" class="h4">211.d. Class 4 Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>A Class 4 or better community must demonstrate that it has programs that minimize flood losses, minimize increases in future flooding, protect natural floodplain functions, and protect people from the dangers of flooding. Even though it may have enough points, a community that cleared most of the buildings from its floodplain with disaster assistance funds after a flood cannot be a Class 4 or better if it does not have an effective regulatory program to prevent a recurrence of the problem.</p>
  <p>In order to be a Class 4 or better, a community must demonstrate that it has enough points to warrant the class and meet the following prerequisites.</p>
  <ol class="paren-numlist">
    <li>
      The community must meet all the Class 6 prerequisites.
    </li>
    <li>
      The community must have received and continue to maintain a classification of 4/4 or better under the BCEGS.
    </li>
    <li>
      The community must demonstrate that it has taken appropriate steps to eliminate or minimize future flood losses. To do this, a Class 4 or better community must receive credit for the following activities.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Activity 430 (Higher Regulatory Standards)—The community must show that it enforces higher regulatory standards to manage new development in the floodplain.
          <ol>
            <li>
              The community must adopt and enforce at least a 1-foot freeboard requirement (including equipment or mechanical items) for all buildings constructed, substantially improved and/or reconstructed due to substantial damage, and buildings allowed to be floodproofed, throughout its SFHA, except those areas that receive OSP credit under Activity 420 (Open Space Preservation). In unnumbered A, AO, and V Zones, the community must first determine a base flood elevation consistent with the techniques credited under Activity 410 (Flood Hazard Mapping). In other words, a community must enforce one foot of freeboard for all new, substantially damaged, or substantially improved buildings throughout the SFHA to become a Class 4 or better. If the verification threshold for element FRB is not met, including the mechanical/electrical equipment, then the community does not meet the prerequisite.
            </li>
            <li>
              The community must receive at least 700 points (after the impact adjustment) under the other elements of Activity 430 and under Sections 422.a, f, and g under Activity 420 (Open Space Preservation).
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Activity 450 (Stormwater Management)—The credit that can be applied to meeting the Class 4 and Class 1 criteria for natural functions is only the credit for controlling the volume of runoff from new development. The maximum credit is 75 points if the volume of the 100-year event is controlled, 25 points for the 25-year event, and 7 points for the 10-year event. The community must receive the following credits for its watershed management plan(s) (WMP) under Section 452.b:
          <ol>
            <li>WMP1: 90 points (before the impact adjustment) for meeting all of the credit criteria for WMP,
            </li>
            <li>WMP2: 30 points (before the impact adjustment) for managing the runoff from all storms  up to and including the 100-year event to ensure that flood flows downstream of new  development do not increase due to the development, and
            </li>
            <li>An impact adjustment value of rWMP = 0.5 or more. Alternatively, the community may  show that at least 50% of the watershed area where future growth is expected is covered  by one or more credited watershed management plans.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          Activity 510 (Floodplain Management Planning)—The community must have adopted and be implementing a floodplain management plan that receives at least 50% of the maximum credit under Activity 510, calculated after the impact adjustment. This 50% of the maximum credit must include at least 50% of the available points in each of planning steps 2, 5, and 8.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Obtain a minimum total credit of 100 points (after the impact adjustment) from one or a combination of the following elements that credit protecting natural floodplain functions:
      <ol>
        <li>420—Natural functions open space (NFOS),</li>
        <li>420—Natural shoreline protection (NSP),</li>
        <li>430—Prohibition of fill (DL1),</li>

        <li>Obtain some credit under Activity 610 (Flood Warning and Response).</li>
        <li>Have a map of all levees and all areas protected by levees, and an inventory of the types of buildings (residential, commercial, etc.) and the critical facilities that would be exposed to flooding should the levee(s) be overtopped or fail. This is the same as activity credit criterion (3) under Activity 620 (Levees), Section 621.b.</li>
        <li>Have a description of the dam failure threat, including a map of all areas that would be flooded by the failure of each high-hazard-potential dam that affects the community, and the types of buildings (residential, commercial, etc.) and critical facilities that would be flooded. This is the same as activity credit criteria (2) under Activity 630 (Dams), Section 631.b.</li>
      </ol>

  <h2 id="211e-title" class="h4">211.e. Class 1 Prerequisites</h2>
  <p>
    In order to be a Class 1, a community must demonstrate that it has enough points to warrant the class AND meet the following prerequisites.
  </p>
  <ol class="paren-numlist">
    <li>
        Meet all the Class 4 prerequisites.
    </li>
    <li>
        Meet the minimum standards of the NFIP as determined by a Community Assistance Visit conducted by FEMA within the previous 12 months.
    </li>
    <li>
        Promote flood insurance as a vital way to protect residents and businesses from the financial impact of a flood. This is demonstrated by having at least 50% of the buildings in the community’s SFHA covered by a flood insurance policy or obtaining at least 50% of the maximum points under Activity 370 (Flood Insurance Promotion).
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Demonstrate that it has a “no adverse impact” approach to floodplain management. A no adverse impact approach is one in which the action of one property owner or community does not adversely affect the flood risks for other properties or communities. “Adverse impact” is measured by increased flood stages, increased flood velocity, increased flows, or the increased potential for erosion and sedimentation. The “no adverse impact” concept is explained in more detail in papers published by the Association of State Floodplain Managers, which can be accessed at www.floods.org.</p>
      <p>This prerequisite is demonstrated by receiving credit under the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          For all of the floodplains in the community:
          <ol>
            <li>
              The community must be enforcing regulations that discourage development in the floodplain. This is demonstrated by receiving a combined total of at least 150 points (before the impact adjustment) from open space incentives (OSI) in Section 422.e and development limitations (DL) in Section 432.a.
            </li>
            <li>
              All new critical facilities must be protected to the 500-year flood level. This is demonstrated by receiving credit under protecting critical facilities (PCF) in Section 432.f in Activity 430 (Higher Regulatory Standards) and by enforcing the regulations throughout the 500-year floodplain.
            </li>
            <li>
              The community must have mapped and be enforcing regulations appropriate for all flood-related hazards within its jurisdiction. This is demonstrated by receiving credit under Activities 410 and 430 for all special flood-related hazards that are identified in the community’s floodplain management or hazard mitigation plan credited under Activity 510 (Floodplain Management Planning).
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          In the community’s riverine floodplains:
          <ol>
            <li>
              The community’s program must address potential increases in riverine flood elevations caused by new development. This is demonstrated by receiving the following credits:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Activity 450 (Stormwater Management)—an impact adjustment value of rWMP = 0.75 or more. As an alternative, the community may show that at least 75% of the watershed area where future growth is expected is covered by one or more credited watershed management plans; and
                </li>
                <li>
                  All riverine floodplains must be mapped using fully developed watershed hydrology as credited under the higher study standard credit (HSS) in Section 412.d.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
          In the community’s coastal floodplains:
          <ol>
            <li>
              The community must receive credit for regulating new development in coastal A Zones under CAZ in Section 432.k.
            </li>
            <li>
              The community must receive credit for regulating new development in areas subject to erosion (CER) under Activity 430 (or demonstrate that it does not have a coastal erosion problem).
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Have a commitment to mitigate its repetitive loss problem as well as problems caused by other natural hazards.
      <ol>
        <li>
          Section 501 (Repetitive Loss List): The community must demonstrate that at least 25% of the properties on its current FEMA repetitive loss list have been protected from damage from repetitive flooding through acquisition, retrofitting, or structural flood control projects.
        </li>
        <li>
          Activity 510 (Floodplain Management Planning): The community must have a multi-hazard mitigation plan that has been approved by FEMA as meeting all of the requirements outlined under 44 CFR §201.6.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      Protect natural floodplain functions. This is demonstrated by having a total credit of at least 150 points (after the impact adjustment) from one or a combination of the elements listed under the Class 4 prerequisite in Section 211.c(4).
    </li>
    <li>
      Have a program to address the threat to life safety that flooding poses to the residents of the community. This is demonstrated by receiving the following credits:
      <ol>
        <li>
          The community must obtain some credit under all the elements in Activity 620 (Levees) for all levees mapped and identified in the inventory prepared for the Class 4 prerequisite in Section 211.c(5)(b).
        </li>
        <li>
          The community must obtain some credit under all the local elements in Activity 630 (Dams) for all areas mapped and identified as subject to dam failure flooding in the inventory prepared for the Class 4 prerequisite in Section 211.c(5)(c). The credit for the state’s program (SDS) is not counted toward this prerequisite.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    In accordance with Section 113.d, the community may propose alternative approaches to these prerequisites that are more appropriate for local conditions.
