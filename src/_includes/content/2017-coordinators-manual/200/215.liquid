  <h2 id="215a-title" class="h4">215.a. Changes Initiated by the Community</h2>
  <p>
    A community’s credit points can change due to the following actions initiated by the community:
  </p>
  <ol class="paren-numlist">
    <li>
      The community may request a modification to improve a class at any time (Section 214).
    </li>
    <li>
      The community may gain or lose points during the cycle verification visit, if it adds or drops activities, or if it cannot submit the materials needed to document the credit.
    </li>
    <li>
      The community will lose points if it fails to recertify that it is continuing to meet the prerequisites and implement all the activities for which it was receiving credit (Section 213).
    </li>
    <li>
      If credit points are dependent upon another agency or organizations (see Section 231.d), the community may gain or lose points based on the other agency’s or organization’s actions. An example of this is the credit for the state’s dam safety program (SDS) under Activity 630 (Dams).
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2 id="215b-title" class="h4">215.b. Changes in the ”Coordinator’s Manual”</h2>
  <p>
    From time to time, the “Coordinator’s Manual” is revised. Revisions are made with an eye toward minimizing loss of credit for communities already participating in the program. Revisions are normally limited to once every three years.
  </p>
  <p>
    Communities keep their credit points by continuing to meet the specifications of the “Coordinator’s Manual” that was in effect at their last verification visit, including the requirements for the annual recertification. At a community’s first cycle verification visit after the new “Coordinator’s Manual” goes into effect, local program credits are re-calculated according to the new “Coordinator’s Manual.”

  <h2 id="215c-title" class="h4">215.c. Changes in the Floodplain Map</h2>
  <p>
    A community’s credit points can be affected by annexations or flood control projects that change the floodplain boundaries. These changes can affect the areas or buildings credited under several activities and the impact adjustment calculations. If a project or annexation is contemplated, the CRS Coordinator should contact the Contractor to review its impact on the community’s credit points.
  </p>

      Example 215.c-1
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">
        A flood control project results in a map revision that removes 100 buildings from the SFHA. Twelve of the buildings had been retrofitted and were credited under Activity 530 (Flood Protection). Those buildings are no longer eligible for retrofitting credit because Activity 530 only credits retrofitted buildings that are in the regulatory floodplain.
      </p>

      Example 215.c-2
    </div>
    <div class="card-body">
      <p class="card-text">
        A community annexes an area that includes a large amount of floodplain. The result doubles the size of the community’s SFHA. The community will lose credit points under Activity 420 (Open Space Preservation) if the open space now makes up a smaller portion of the SFHA. Conversely, if the annexed area includes a large amount of preserved open space, the community’s credit under Activity 420 could increase.

  <h2 id="215d-title" class="h4">215.d. New Development</h2>
  <p>
  A community’s credit points can be affected by new development. Several activities’ credits are
  modified by an impact adjustment based on the number of buildings in the SFHA. An example is
  Activity 520 (Acquisition and Relocation), which adjusts the credit based on the ratio of the number
  of buildings cleared out of the regulatory floodplain to the number of buildings remaining in the
  SFHA. If the community permits more new buildings in the floodplain, the number of buildings in the
  SFHA increases and the total credit for Activity 520 would decrease.
  </p>
  <p>
  New development in the county will also affect the county growth adjustment (CGA, explained in
  Section 710). A growing county will mean an increase in points in the 400 series. If the growth rate
  declines over time, the total points could decrease.
