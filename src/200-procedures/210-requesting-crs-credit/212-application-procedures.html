<h3>212.a. Application Request</h3>

<p>
  Application for a CRS classification is voluntary. A community can request a
  CRS classification at any time.
</p>

<p>
  A community can request a CRS classification for any activities and elements,
  provided that
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The credit points add up to at least 500 points, enough to become a Class 9;
    and
  </li>
  <li>
    The community can meet all of the Class 9 prerequisites (Section 211.a).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The following documentation is needed to request a CRS classification. Both
  items can be submitted digitally to
  <a href="mailto:NFIPCRS@ISO.com">NFIPCRS@ISO.com</a> (letters needing
  signatures should be scanned and sent as PDF files).
</p>

<ol class="paren-numlist">
  <li>
    A letter of interest sent to the FEMA Regional Office that
    <ul>
      <li>States that the community is interested in joining the CRS,</li>
      <li>Designates the community’s CRS Coordinator,</li>
      <li>
        States that the community will cooperate with the verification process,
        and
      </li>
      <li>
        States that the community understands that approval from the FEMA
        Regional Office is needed for the ISO/CRS Specialist to visit the
        community and verify the creditable activities.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The letter is signed by the community’s CEO and is sent to the FEMA
      Regional Office. Copies of the letter are also sent to the State NFIP
      Coordinator and the Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO). Example
      language can be obtained from the ISO/CRS Specialist for the community’s
      area. An example letter is included in the “Community Rating System (CRS)
      Application Letter of Interest and CRS Quick Check,” available at
      <a href="https://www.CRSresources.org/200">www.CRSresources.org/200</a>.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    Documentation showing that the community is implementing activities that
    warrant at least 500 points to be at least a CRS Class 9. This can be done
    by using the CRS Quick Check, available at
    <a href="https://www.CRSresources.org/200">www.CRSresources.org/200</a>, a
    state-specific equivalent recommended by the ISO/CRS Specialist, or another
    method that shows each creditable element that the community can document as
    meeting the credit requirements.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  If the community’s submittal is complete and shows that 500 or more credit
  points are likely, the ISO/CRS Specialist will contact the FEMA Regional
  Office for approval to conduct an initial verification visit with the
  community. This is only approval for ISO to commence the application process.
  As described in Section 211.a (2), communities must meet the minimum standards
  of the NFIP as determined by a Community Assistance Visit conducted by FEMA
  within six months of the verification visit. Therefore, the Regional Office
  (or State NFIP Coordinator) may opt to conduct the Community Assistance Visit
  before giving approval for the verification visit.
</p>

<p>
  When approval is received, the ISO/CRS Specialist will contact the community
  to schedule the initial verification visit. At the visit, the CRS is explained
  and each activity likely to receive credit is reviewed. The conduct of the
  verification visit is explained in Section 230.
</p>

<h3>212.b. Application Documentation</h3>

<p>
  The ISO/CRS Specialist schedules the initial verification visit to review the
  community’s programs and activities. The ISO/CRS Specialist collects the
  needed materials from community staff. Before the materials can be processed,
  the ISO/CRS Specialist must have the following five items. Some of the
  documentation can be provided digitally.
</p>

<ol class="paren-numlist">
  <li>
    Correspondence from the FEMA Regional Office stating that the community is
    in full compliance with the minimum requirements of the NFIP (see Section
    211.a(2)).
  </li>
  <li>
    The CRS Program Data Table, with lines 6 and 13 completed (see Figure
    210-2). The CRS Program Data Table is the second page of the “CC-213
    Recertification” form. The CRS Community Certifications are included in
    Appendix E and also are available at
    <a href="https://www.CRSresources.org/200">www.CRSresources.org/200</a>. For
    a community’s initial application to the CRS, only the second page of the
    CC-213 Recertification is required (page CC-213-2).
  </li>
  <li>
    Documentation for each element for which credit is desired. Sections 310–630
    have documentation sections that itemize what is needed. The ISO/CRS
    Specialist reviews these with the community during the visit and collects
    what is needed. Section 231 reviews how documentation should be provided by
    the community.
  </li>
  <li>
    A certification signed by the community’s CEO that says
    <blockquote>
      I hereby certify that ___________________________ [community name] is
      implementing the following activities (check the ones that apply). We will
      continue to implement these activities and will advise FEMA if any of them
      are not being conducted in accordance with this certification. We will
      cooperate with the ISO/CRS Specialist ’s verification visit and will
      submit the documentation and annual recertification needed to validate our
      program.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The certification is included in the “CC-230 Verification Certification”
      form, which is the verification cover page provided by the ISO/CRS
      Specialist. The CRS Community Certifications are included in Appendix E
      and are available at
      <a href="https://www.CRSresources.org/200">www.CRSresources.org/200</a>.
      Figure 230-1 shows a sample CC-231. The community may propose alternative
      language.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    A certification signed by the community’s CEO that says
    <blockquote>
      I hereby certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief, we are
      maintaining in force all flood insurance policies that have been required
      of us as a condition of federal financial assistance for insurable
      buildings owned by us and located in the Special Flood Hazard Area shown
      on our Flood Insurance Rate Map. I further understand that disaster
      assistance for any community-owned building located in the Special Flood
      Hazard Area is reduced by the amount of NFIP flood insurance coverage
      (structural and contents) that a community should be carrying on the
      building, regardless of whether the community is carrying a policy.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The flood insurance prerequisite is explained in more detail in Figure 210
      -1. The certification is included in a cover sheet provided by the ISO/CRS
      Specialist. This certification is also included in the “CC-230
      Verification Certification” form. The community may propose alternative
      language.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>212.c. Verification Processing</h3>

<p>
  After the verification visit is done and all needed documentation has been
  received, the ISO/CRS Specialist produces a verification report. FEMA and ISO
  need several months to review, double check, and confirm the ISO/CRS
  Specialist’s verification report. FEMA makes the final decision on the
  community’s credit and classification.
</p>

<p>
  Once FEMA confirms the community’s classification, it must give the insurance
  companies a four-month advance notice, so they can advise their agents of the
  rating change before policies are renewed. Therefore, a community’s
  classification will take effect on the May 1 or October 1 about 8–12 months
  after the verification visit.
</p>

<h3>212.d. Reinstating Previous CRS Communities</h3>

<p>
  If a CRS community retrograded to a Class 10 for whatever reason, it may apply
  to be reclassified as a Class 9 or better community. Such a community must
  submit a complete new application according to the Coordinator’s Manual
  currently in effect. It may not submit a modification or documentation just to
  correct the problem activities
</p>
