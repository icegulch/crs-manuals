## 212 Application Procedures

The documentation and procedures for joining the Community Rating System (CRS) are listed. Most of what is needed is collected at the initial verification visit.

## 213 Recertification

Each year, the community’s chief executive officer must recertify that the community is continuing to implement the activities for which credit has been provided.

## 214 Modifications

A community may modify its CRS classification by applying for credit for new elements or activities, dropping one or more elements or activities, or submitting revised versions of materials.

## 215 Changes in CRS Credit

A community’s credit points can change when it changes its activities, when the CRS Coordinator’s Manual is revised, when its floodplain map is revised, and/or if it allows more development in the floodplain.
