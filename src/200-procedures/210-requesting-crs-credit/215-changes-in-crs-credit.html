<h3>215.a. Changes Initiated by the Community</h3>

<p>
  A community’s credit points can change due to the following actions initiated
  by the community:
</p>

<ol class="paren-numlist">
  <li>
    The community may request a modification to improve a class at any time
    (Section 214).
  </li>
  <li>
    The community may gain or lose points during the cycle verification visit,
    if it adds or drops activities, or if it cannot submit the materials needed
    to document the credit.
  </li>
  <li>
    The community will lose points if it fails to recertify that it is
    continuing to meet the prerequisites and implement all the activities for
    which it was receiving credit (Section 213).
  </li>
  <li>
    If credit points are dependent upon another agency or organizations (see
    Section 231.d), the community may gain or lose points based on the other
    agency’s or organization’s actions. An example of this is the credit for the
    state’s dam safety program (SDS) under Activity 630 (Dams).
  </li>
</ol>

<h3>215.b. Changes in the CRS Coordinator’s Manual</h3>

<p>
  From time to time, the Coordinator’s Manual is revised. Revisions are made
  with an eye toward minimizing loss of credit for communities already
  participating in the CRS. Revisions are normally limited to once every three
  years.
</p>

<p>
  Communities keep their credit points by continuing to meet the specifications
  of the Coordinator’s Manual that was in effect at their last verification
  visit, including the requirements for the annual recertification. At a
  community’s first cycle verification visit AFTER the new Coordinator’s Manual
  goes into effect, local program credits are recalculated according to the new
  Coordinator’s Manual.
</p>

<h3>215.c. Changes in the Floodplain Map</h3>

<p>
  A community’s credit points can be affected by annexations or flood control
  projects that change the floodplain boundaries. These changes can affect the
  areas or buildings credited under several activities and the impact adjustment
  calculations. If a project or annexation is contemplated, the CRS Coordinator
  should contact the ISO/CRS Specialist to review its impact on the community’s
  credit points.
</p>

<div class="example">
  <h4>Example 215.c-1.</h4>
  <p>
    A flood control project results in a map revision that removes 100 buildings
    from the SFHA. Twelve of the buildings had been retrofitted and were
    credited under Activity 530 (Flood Protection). Those buildings are no
    longer eligible for retrofitting credit because Activity 530 only credits
    retrofitted buildings that are in the regulatory floodplain.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="example">
  <h4>Example 215.c-2.</h4>
  <p>
    A community annexes an area that includes a large amount of floodplain. The
    result doubles the size of the community’s SFHA. The community will lose
    credit points under Activity 420 (Open Space Preservation) if the open space
    now makes up a smaller portion of the SFHA.
  </p>
  <p>
    Conversely, if the annexed area includes a large amount of preserved open
    space, the community’s credit under Activity 420 could increase.
  </p>
