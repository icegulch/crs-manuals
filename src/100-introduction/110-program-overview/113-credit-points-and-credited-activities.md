To be recognized in the insurance rating system, local floodplain management activities must be described, measured, and evaluated by the CRS. The basic document detailing the program is the CRS Coordinator’s Manual. It sets forth the procedures, creditable activities, and the credit points assigned to each activity, and gives examples of activities and how their credit is calculated.

## 113.a. Credit Points and Classification

A community receives a CRS classification based upon the total credit for its activities. There are 10 CRS classes. Class 1 requires the most credit points and gives the greatest premium reduction or discount. A community that does not apply for the CRS, or does not obtain the minimum number of credit points, is a Class 10 community and receives no discount on premiums. The qualifying community total points, CRS classes, and flood insurance premium discounts are shown in Table 110-1.

The flood insurance premium discount is based on whether a property is in or out of the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA), i.e., the zones beginning with the letter A and V as shown on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The premium discount for properties in the SFHA increases according to the community’s CRS class. A community’s classification is based on the community total points (symbolized as cT in the CRS calculations).

The discount for properties outside the SFHA is lower for Class 1–8 communities because premiums in these areas are already relatively low and can be lowered further through the Preferred Risk Policy. Also, most activities undertaken to qualify for those classes are implemented only in the floodplain. Because areas designated as A99 and AR Zones already receive an insurance premium reduction, these zones get the same premium reduction as non-SFHA areas.

## 113.b. Credited Activities

There are 19 creditable activities, organized under four categories, which are presented in the 300–600 series of the Coordinator’s Manual. The Coordinator’s Manual assigns credit points based upon the extent to which an activity advances the three goals of the CRS.

<dl>
  <dt style="font-weight:600">Public Information Activities (300 Series)</dt>
  <dd>
    This series credits programs that advise people about the flood hazard, encourage the purchase of flood insurance, and provide information about ways to reduce flood damage. These activities also generate data needed by insurance agents for accurate flood insurance rating. They generally serve all members of the community.
  </dd>

  <dt style="font-weight:600">Mapping and Regulations (400 Series)</dt>
  <dd>
    This series credits programs that provide increased protection to new develop ment. These activities include mapping areas not shown on the FIRM, preserving open space, protect ing natural floodplain functions, enforcing higher regulatory standards, and managing stormwater. The credit is increased for growing communities.
  </dd>

  <dt style="font-weight:600">Flood Damage Reduction Activities (500 Series)</dt>
  <dd>
    This series credits programs for areas in which existing development is at risk. Cre dit is provided for a comprehensive floodplain management plan, relocating or retrofitting flood prone structures, and maintaining drainage systems.
  </dd>

  <dt style="font-weight:600">Warning and Response (600 Series)</dt>
  <dd>
    This series provides credit for measures that protect life and property during a flood, through flood warning and response programs. There is credit for the maintenance of levees and for state regulatory programs for dams, as well as for programs that prepare for the potential failure of levees and dams.

Some CRS activities may be implemented by the state or a regional agency rather than by the community. For example, some states have hazard disclosure laws that are creditable under Activity 340 (Flood Hazard Disclosure). A community in those states will receive those credit points when it applies for CRS credit and demonstrates that the law is effectively implemented within its jurisdiction. See also Section 231.c.

## 113.c. Activity Credit Points

The 19 activities and their credit points are shown in Table 110-2. Each activity has one or more elements. Elements are the basic credit level for the CRS. The element and activity scoring process is covered in Activity 220 (Credit Calculation).

The maximum credit points for each activity are shown in the second column. The
maximum credit can be earned when all elements within an activity are being implemented and all credit criteria are met. In some activities, maximum credit cannot be provided unless credit has been earned in other activities. For example, additional credit is provided in some activities if the community has adopted a Program for Public Information under Activity 330 (Outreach Projects).

The third column and fourth columns in Table 110-2 show the estimated maximum credit and average credit points using a conservative model to convert the points received under the 2007 _Coordinator’s Manual_ to the new scoring in the 2013 and 2017 _Coordinator’s Manuals_. The maximums and averages are based upon the number of applicants for each activity, not the total number of applicants for the CRS. The fifth column shows the percentage of all CRS communities that received credit for each activity as of May 2013.

Communities should note the average credits for these activities. They provide a better indication of what an applicant can expect for an activity than do the maximum points available.

A community must have at least 500 verified credit points to become a Class 9 or better. It must also meet the prerequisites for certain classes, as described in Section 211. As explained in Activity 230 (Verification), the final, or verified, credit is calculated by the ISO/CRS Specialist after a review of the documentation provided by the community and the community’s implementation of its activities at the verification visit (explained in Section 232).

The CRS “Quick Check” is a tool that a community can use to assess its potential for receiving CRS credit for activities it is undertaking. The Quick Check can be found at [www.CRSresources.org/200](https://www.CRSresources.org/200).

The Quick Check does not estimate credit for a community. However, by reviewing each element and going through the steps explained in Section 220, a community can assess its potentially creditable activities.

There are three important things to note when estimating credit:

1. Moving to a Class 6, 4, or 1 depends on both having adequate points AND meeting class prerequisites, as explained in Section 211.
2. Many CRS activities have an impact adjustment associated with them. An impact adjustment means that CRS credit is provided for the portion of the regulatory floodplain to which the creditable element is applied. For example, even though 1,450 maximum points are available for open space preservation (OSP), if a community has 20% of the regulatory floodplain as open space, then the credit will be 20% of the allowable credit, or 290 points. See Section 222.
2. Only the final, verified credit calculated by the ISO/CRS Specialist after the verification visit determines a community’s total points. It is important that the community provide correct and complete materials to document its activities. Only through a review of the community’s documentation can the ISO/CRS Specialist determine the credit points that should be provided.

A community should apply only for those activities it is actively undertaking and those it knows it can implement in accordance with the Coordinator’s Manual. For example, no credit is provided for draft ordinances—regulations must have been enacted and enforced.

Also, a community should not be overly ambitious in undertaking new activities for CRS credit at the risk of losing the credit later (at annual recertification or cycle verification visits) for activities it is unable to implement or continue.

## 113.d. Activities not Listed

The CRS activities are not design standards for local floodplain management. The Coordinator’s Manual is an insurance tool that describes methods of calculating credit points for various community activities. The fact that the Coordinator’s Manual does not list a specific credit for some activities does not mean that they should not be implemented by communities that need them.

An activity may deserve credit even if the Coordinator’s Manual does not include it. The Coordinator’s Manual cannot predict or list everything that can be done to support the goals of the CRS. Communities are always welcome to request credit for alternate approaches or innovations that are not included in the Coordinator’s Manual. Similarly, communities can submit alternative approaches to the class prerequisites listed in Section 211.

Requests should be submitted to the ISO/CRS Specialist and should include documentation to support how the alternative approach or innovation meets the intent of , or is equivalent to, the prerequisite or the element and/or activity credited in the Coordinator’s Manual.

Note that some activities are not directly recognized by the CRS for one of three reasons: 

1. They do not directly affect buildings that can be insured under the NFIP (e .g., uninsurable items such as streets and land value);
2. They are recognized by other aspects of the flood insurance rating program (e.g., flood control projects that result in revised FIRMs reduce flood insurance premiums in protected areas); or
3. The impact of an activity cannot be measured for CRS credit (e.g., preserving floodplains for aesthetic reasons).

Credit criteria will change over time as experience is gained in implementing, observing, and measuring the activities and as new concepts in floodplain management come into common practice. As innovations arise, they will be considered for recognition under the CRS.
