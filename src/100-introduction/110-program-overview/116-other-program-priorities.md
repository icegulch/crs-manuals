## 116.a. Natural Floodplain Functions

Floodplains in riverine and coastal areas perform natural functions that cannot be replicated elsewhere. The CRS provides special credit for community activities that protect and/or restore natural floodplain functions, even though some of the activities may not directly reduce flood losses to insurable buildings. There are many reasons to protect floodplains in their natural state.
When kept open and free of development, floodplains provide the necessary flood water conveyance and flood water storage needed by a river or coastal system.

When the floodplain is allowed to perform its natural function, flood velocities and peak flows are
reduced downstream. Natural floodplains reduce wind and wave impacts and their vegetation stabilizes soils during flooding.

Floodplains in their natural state provide many beneficial functions beyond flood reduction. Water
quality is improved in areas where natural cover acts as a filter for runoff and overbank flows; sediment loads and impuri ties are also minimized. Natural floodplains moderate water temperature, reducing the possibility of adverse impacts on aquatic plants and animals.

Floodplains can act as recharge areas for groundwater and reduce the frequency and duration of low flows of surface water. They provide habitat for diverse species of flora and fauna, some of which cannot live anywhere else. They are particularly important as breeding and feeding areas.

The CRS encourages state, local and private programs and projects that preserve or restore the natural state of floodplains and protect these functions. The CRS also encourages communities to coordinate their flood loss reduction programs with other public and private activities that preserve and protect natural and beneficial floodplain functions. Credits for doing this are found in the following activities:

- Activity 320 (Map Information Service)—Credits advising people about areas that should be protected because of their natural floodplain functions.
- Activity 330 (Outreach Projects)—Credit is provided for outreach projects that include descriptions of the natural functions of the community’s floodplains.
- Activity 350 (Flood Protection Information)—Credit points are available for a website that provides detailed information about local areas that should be pr otected for their natural floodplain functions and how they can be protected.
- Activity 420 (Open Space Preservation)—Extra credit is provided for open space areas that are preserved in their natural state; have been restored to a condition approximating their pre-development natural state; or have been designated as worthy of preservation for their natural benefits, such as being designated in a habitat conservation plan.
- Activity 430 (Higher Regulatory Standards)—Regulations that protect natural areas during development or that protect water quality are credited.
- Activity 440 (Flood Data Maintenance)—Adding layers to the community’s geographic information system (GIS) with natural floodplain functions (e.g., wetlands, designated riparian habitat, flood water storage areas) is credited.
- Activity 450 (Stormwater Management)—Erosion and sediment control, water quality, and low-impact development techniques minimize the impacts of new development. These measures are credited, along with regulations that require the maintenance of natural flow regimes.
- Activity 510 (Floodplain Management Planning)—Extra credit is provided for plans that address the natural resources of floodplains and recommend ways to protect them.
- Activities 520 (Acquisition and Relocation), 530 (Flood Protection), and 540 (Drainage System Maintenance) credit flood loss reduction measures such as capital improvement programs and drainage improvement projects. No such programs or projects can be credited unless a thorough environmental review is conducted and documented. 

## 116.b. All-Hazards Mitigation

All communities are threatened by a variety of natural and technological hazards. The staff
and programs that address flooding may also be responsible for protecting the community
from damage due to earthquakes, hurricanes, landslides, drought, hazardous materials
incidents, and terrorism. Similarly, the staff members that work in programs related to other
hazards may be implementing activities that could support floodplain management programs. Floodplain management programs are synonymous with flood mitigation programs.

FEMA supports an all-hazards approach to mitigation, as does the CRS. It makes economic sense that mitigation programs address as many hazards as are appropriate. An all -hazards approach also ensures that staff, programs, construction standards, and public information messages are consistent and mutually supportive.

The CRS has become an important tool for mitigation as well as a mechanism for integrating mitigation with flood insurance. This is consistent not only with grading systems that have been successfully employed for many years in the insurance industry, but also with industry initiatives for relating insurance premiums to local efforts to reduce losses due to natural hazards. For example, adoption and enforcement of strong building codes as measured by the insurance industry’s Building Code Effectiveness Grading Schedule integrates building code enforcement into the industry’s premium rates.

“ The CRS has served as a model for all-hazards, pre-disaster mitigation. Local officials have reported that the CRS was the blueprint for organizing their program to build a more disaster-resistant community.

This edition of the Coordinator’s Manual highlights many opportunities for expanding a flood-only orientation to address other hazards.

- The 300 series of public information activities credits advising people about the risk of flooding and other hazards and the mitigation measures they can take to protect their property;
- Under Activity 340 (Hazard Disclosure), disclosure of other hazards (DOH) credits advising potential purchasers of property that there may be other hazards that could affect the property, such as erosion, subsidence, or flooding from a dam failure (Section 342.d);
- Section 401 has an overview of the additional credits that are provided for managing seven special flood-related hazards:
  - Uncertain flow paths (alluvial fans, moveable bed streams, and other floodplains within which the channel moves during a flood);
  - Closed-basin lakes;
  - Ice jams;
  - Land subsidence;
  - Mudflow hazards;
  - Coastal erosion; and
  - Tsunamis.
- Activity 420 (Open Space Preservation) encourages communities to keep hazardous areas open and undeveloped;
- Credit is provided for the International Series of building codes (which have improved protection standards for flooding, wind, and other hazards over previous model codes) in Activity 430 (Higher Regulatory Standards), Section 432.h; • Activity 430 (Higher Regulatory Standards) also credits extending V-Zone standards for coastal storm surge and wind protection farther inland to include coastal A Zones (Section 432.k);
- In Activity 440 (Flood Data Maintenance), additional credit is provided for showing areas subject to other natural hazards, such as landslides and stream migration in the GIS or data base management program;
- Under Activity 450 (Stormwater Management), management of runoff, erosion and sediment control, and water quality and low impact development requirements to minimize the impacts of new development are credited.
- More credit is available for including other hazards in a mitigation plan that qualifies for a floodplain management plan under Activity 510 (Floodplain Management Planning); and
- Local warning and public information activities directed toward storms and tsunamis are credited under the StormReady and TsunamiReady elements in Activity 610 (Flood Warning and Response).

## 116.c. Future Conditions and Impacts of Climate Change

The CRS recognizes that floodplains and watersheds change over time, driven by many natural and manmade changes. Good floodplain management acknowledges this, and includes thinking about how floodplains might look in the future under different scenarios. Increased impervious surfaces in developing watersheds, new fill in floodways, rising sea levels, changes in natural functions, and many other factors contribute to the c haracter of the future with which floodplain managers must cope.

The Coordinator’s Manual incorporates additional acknowledgement of—and credit for— community efforts to anticipate the future insofar as it relates to flood risk an d natural floodplain functions and climate resilience, and to take actions that can mitigate any adverse impacts that could materialize.

- Credit is provided in Section 322.c for communities that provide information about areas (not mapped on the FIRM) that are predicted to be susceptible to flooding in the future because of climate change or sea level rise.
- To become a Class 4 or better community, a community must (among other criteria) demonstrate that it has programs that minimize increases in future flooding.
- To achieve CRS Class 1, a community must receive credit for using regulatory flood elevations in the V and coastal A Zones that reflect future conditions, including sea level rise.
- Credit is provided in Section 342.d when prospective buyers of a property are advised of the potential for flooding due to climate changes and/or sea level rise.
- Credit is provided in Section 412.d when the community’s regulatory map is based on future-conditions hydrology, including sea level rise.
- Credit is provided in Section 432.k when a community accounts for sea level rise in managing its coastal A Zones.
- Credit is provided in Section 452.a if a community’s stormwater program regulates runoff from future development.
- Credit is provided in Section 452.b for a community whose watershed master plan manages future peak flows so that they do not exceed present values.
- Credit is provided in Section 452.b for a coastal community whose watershed master plan addresses the impact of sea level rise.
- Credit is provided in Section 512.a, Steps 4 and 5, for flood hazard assessment and problem analysis that address areas likely to flood and flood problems that are likely to get worse in the future, including (1) changes in floodplain development and demographics, (2) development in the watershed, and (3) climate change or sea level rise.

Guidance on the sea level rise projections that are to be used for the purpose of CRS credit can be found in Section 404.
