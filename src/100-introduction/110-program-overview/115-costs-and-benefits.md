Communities should prepare and implement those activities which best deal with th eir local problems, whether or not they are creditable under the CRS. Few, if any, of the CRS activities will produce premium reductions equal to or greater than the cost of their implementation. In considering whether to undertake a new floodplain management activity, a community must consider all of the benefits the activity will provide (not just insurance premium reductions) in order to determine whether it is worth implementing.

## 115.a. Costs

No fee is charged for a community to apply for participation in the CRS. The only costs the community incurs are those of implementing creditable floodplain management activities and the staff time needed to document those activities and prepare for and participate in the recertification process and verification visits.

## 115.b. Benefits

There are many benefits to participating in the CRS. Most of them cannot be measured in direct dollar terms, so it is impossible to conduct a strict numerical comparison of the benefits with the costs of implementing the credited activities. Listed here are the benefits more commonly mentioned by community officials.

1. The benefit that attracts people to the CRS the most is the reduction in flood insurance premiums for their residents and businesses. The dollar savings varies according to the CRS class, the number of policies, and the amount of coverage. A community can obtain the current and potential dollar savings for all 10 classes from its ISO/CRS Specialist. These are known as the “what if” tables (see Figure 110-1).
2. Although the premium reduction attracts interest in the CRS, the most important benefits are the enhanced public safety, reduction in damage to property and public infrastructure, avoidance of economic disruption and losses, reduction in human suffering, and protection of the environment provided by the credited activities. Community officials agree that these programs are improved when changes are made to meet the CRS credit criteria.
3. Through the CRS a community can evaluate the effectiveness of its flood program against state and nationally recognized benchmarks.
4. Training and technical assistance in designing and implementing credited flood protection activities are available through the CRS at no charge.
5. Many communities initiate new public information activities when they join the CRS. These build a knowledgeable constituency within the community—people who become more interested in protecting themselves from flooding and in supporting the community’s floodplain management efforts.
6. Keeping its CRS credits has proven to be an effective motivator to continue implementing flood protection programs during the “dry years.” The fact that the community’s CRS status could be affected by the elimination of a flood-related activity or a weakening of the regulatory requirements for new development has been taken into account by many governing boards when considering such actions.
7. There is mutual support among CRS participants. Communities that participate in the CRS are joining the ranks of localities that have demonstrated a serious commitment to the health, safety, and welfare of their residents—and their floodplain and coastal resources. Across the nation, “CRS users groups” of representatives of counties, communities, and regional entities have formed to share their experiences, support each other in advancing their floodplain management programs, and encourage other communities to participate in the program.
