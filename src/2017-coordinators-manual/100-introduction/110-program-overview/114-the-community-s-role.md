## 114.a. Community Participation

Community participation in the CRS is voluntary. Any community in full comp liance with the rules and regulations of the NFIP may apply for a CRS classification better than Class 10. A community may apply to participate in the CRS at any time.

The application procedures are simple: the community submits a letter of interest and shows that it is implementing activities that would receive at least 500 credit points. The documents go to the ISO/CRS Specialist for that state. The Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must approve the submittal to ensure that the community is in full compliance with the minimum floodplain management criteria of the NFIP. See also Section 212.

Upon receiving FEMA approval, a community verification visit is scheduled by the ISO/CRS Specialist. At this verification visit, the ISO/CRS Specialist reviews all of the community’s activities that may deserve credit, even those not in the community’s submittal. All CRS credit is verified according to the credit criteria in the Coordinator’s Manual in effect at the time of the visit. The verification process is discussed in Activity 230.

The ISO/CRS Specialist is an employee of Insurance Services Office, Inc. (ISO), FEMA’s CRS management contractor. ISO has many years of experience collecting and processing data for more than 1,000 insurance companies. Among other services, ISO develops and provides advisory classifications for community fire protection and building code programs. ISO reviews CRS submittals, verifies communities’ credit points, and performs program improvement tasks for FEMA.

After the verification visit, ISO submits its findings to FEMA. FEMA sets the CRS credit to be granted and notifies the community, the state, insurance companies, and other appropriate parties. The classification is effective on either May 1 or Octo ber 1, whichever comes first, after the community’s activities are verified.

Each year the community must recertify that it is continuing to perform the activities for which it is receiving CRS credit. Recertification is an annual activity that includes progress reports for certain activities (see Section 213). A “cycle verification visit” takes place every few years and is conducted in the form of another verification visit to the community (see Section 232).

If a community is not properly or fully implementing the credited activities, its credit points, and possibly its CRS classification, will be revised. A community may add credited activities in order to improve its CRS classification. This is called a modification and is explained in Section 214.

Communities are encouraged to call on their ISO/CRS Specialist for assistance at any time. This can be especially helpful when they are considering a change to a credited activity or implementing a new program.

A week-long CRS course for local officials is offered free at FEMA’s Emergency Management Institute and has been field deployed to many states. The ISO/CRS Specialist, NFIP State Coordinator, and FEMA Regional Office have more information on this course, state workshops, and other CRS training opportunities.

## 114.b. Community Responsibilities

Once a community receives its initial classification in the CRS, it must continue to implement its credited activities to keep its classification. Specifically, a community is responsible for

- Designating a community CRS Coordinator—someone who is familiar with the community offices that implement CRS activities;
- Cooperating with the ISO/CRS Specialist and the verification procedures (Section 230);
- Recertifying each year that it is continuing to implement its activities (Section 213);- Advising FEMA and its ISO/CRS Specialist of modifications to its activities (Section 214);
- Keeping elevation certificates, old FIRMs, and old Flood Insurance Studies for as long as the community is in the CRS;
- Keeping the records iterated in the activities’ documentation sections until they are reviewed at the verification visit;
- Ensuring that flood protection projects and drainage system maintenance activities are compliant with federal environmental and historic preservation requirements (Section 507); and
- Participating in the cycle verification process (Section 232).

Communities will receive periodic updates to the Coordinator’s Manual and other CRS materials. They are encouraged to order the background publications (see Appendi x C), attend CRS workshops, and ask their ISO/CRS Specialists for help understanding the CRS credit criteria for their current and planned activities.
