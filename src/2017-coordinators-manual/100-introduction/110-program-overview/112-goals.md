The goals of the NFIP are to provide flood insurance to property owners, to encourage flood loss reduction activities by communities, and to save taxpayers’ money. As a part of the NFIP, the CRS provides both incentives and tools to further these goals.

The CRS recognizes, encourages, and rewards—by the use of flood insurance premium adjustments—community and state activities that go beyond the minimum required by the NFIP to

- Reduce and avoid flood damage to insurable property,
- Strengthen and support the insurance aspects of the NFIP, and
- Foster comprehensive floodplain management.

The purpose of the CRS is to support the NFIP. To do this, the CRS prov ides flood insurance premium rate reductions to policyholders in recognition of the fact that their communities implement activities that exceed the minimum NFIP requirements and that work toward the three goals of the CRS. Included in this support are measures that credit protection to life and property during a flood. A closer look at how communities can implement these three goals follows.

    <h2>Goal 1. Reduce and avoid flood damage to insurable property.</h2>
    <p>
      The CRS supports the NFIP by working to minimize flood losses nationwide, both inside and outside of mapped floodplains. Communities are encouraged to reduce the exposure of existing buildings (and their contents) to flood damage, especially properties that are subject to repetitive flood losses. New buildings and their contents should be protected from known and future local flood hazards. Standards higher than those set out in the minimum criteria of the NFIP may be needed to accomplish these tasks. The CRS encourages communities to map and provide regulatory flood data for all their flood hazards. The data should be used in their regulatory programs and shared with all users and inquirers.

    <h2>Goal 2. Strengthen and support the insurance aspects of the NFIP.</h2>
    <p>
      The CRS recognizes communities whose activities generate and contribute data that enable accurate actuarial rating of flood insurance. Communities are encouraged to implement mapping and information programs that help assess individual property risk and reduce repetitive flood losses. To help expand the policy base, communities should make their residents aware of their flood risk so that they purchase and maintain flood insurance policies.
    </p>
  </li>

  <li>
    <h2>Goal 3. Foster comprehensive floodplain management.</h2>
    <p>
      The CRS encourages communities to use all available tools to implement comprehensive local floodplain management programs, which ordinarily have concerns beyond the protection of insurable property. The CRS recognizes local efforts that protect lives; further public health, safety, and welfare; minimize damage and disruption to infrastructure and critical facilities; preserve and restore the natural functions and resources of floodplains and coastal areas; and ensure that new development does not cause adverse impacts elsewhere in the watershed or on other properties.

A community’s staff should understand the physical and biological processes that form and alter floodplains and watersheds and take steps to deal with flooding, erosion, habitat loss, water quality, and special flood-related hazards. A comprehensive approach includes planning, public information, regulations, financial support, open space protection, public works activities, emergency management, and other appropriate techniques.
