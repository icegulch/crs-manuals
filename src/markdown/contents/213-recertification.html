<p>
  Each year, a community must recertify that it is continuing to meet the
  prerequisites for its class and to implement the activities for which it has
  earned credit. The ISO/CRS Specialist sends the community a list of its
  credited activities, and it is the community’s responsibility to respond by
  the deadline provided with its annual recertification package . The community
  must note whether it is still implementing each item on the list. The
  community’s recertification package can be submitted digitally to the ISO/CRS
  Specialist (documents needing signatures, such as CC-213 Recertification,
  should be scanned and sent as PDF files).
</p>

<p>
  As noted in their credit documentation sections, some activities have
  additional require ments that must be submitted with the annual
  recertification. These are also noted on the list that is sent to the
  community. Examples of additional documentation are a copy of an annual report
  or a copy of an outreach project sent out during the previous year.

<p style="font-variant: small-caps">
  A community that fails to recertify will retrograde to a Class 10.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Failure to submit the listed items or to certify that all prerequisites are
    being met will result in loss of credit for those activities. It is possible
    that a community could lose enough points to cause a change in its CRS
    classification.
  </li>
  <li>
    A repetitive loss community that fails to submit a copy of its annual
    outreach project or a Category C repetitive loss community that fails to
    submit its annual progress report as required by Activity 510 (Floodplain
    Management Planning) will retrograde to a Class 10.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>213.a. Program Data Table</h3>

<p>
  A Program Data Table is included with the annual recertification materials
  sent by the ISO/CRS Specialist. The table is the second page of the CC-213
  Recertification form (page CC-213-2), and is shown in Figure 210-2.
  Communities must include updated data with every annual recertification. The
  Program Data Table is also required at cycle verification visits and is the
  third page of the CC-230 Verification form (page CC-230-3).
</p>

<p>
  The data help both FEMA and the community track floodplain development and
  mapping changes. The table is used by FEMA to help schedule assistance
  activities and set mapping priorities. The numbers are also used to determine
  the impact adjustments needed to calculate activity credit.
