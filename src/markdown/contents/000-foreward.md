The Community Rating System (CRS) is a national program developed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The CRS Coordinator’s Manual spells out the credits and credit criteria of the CRS for community activities and programs that go above and beyond the minimum requirements for participation in FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program. The Coordinator’s Manual is available in Adobe pdf format at [www.CRSresources.org](https://www.crsresources.org/).

## Using the CRS Coordinator’s Manual

The Coordinator’s Manual is the guidebook for the CRS. It explains how the program operates, what is credited, and how credits are calculated. Although it is primarily a reference for CRS activities and credits, it can also help guide communities that want to design or improve their floodplain management programs.

**If you want to know how the CRS works and how your community can benefit** from participating in the program and reduce flood insurance premiums,

- Start with Section 110 for an overview of the program.
- Section 200 describes the procedures for applying, required activities, calculating credits, and advancing in the program. Be sure to review the prerequisites for participation in Section 211.

**If you want to develop a comprehensive community floodplain management program,**

- Start with the CRS Community Self Assessment, Section 240, to help evaluate your existing flood problems and identify potential future flood problems, and to identify appropriate measures to address them.
- Use the results of the CRS Community Self Assessment to determine what additional data you need about your flood problem areas. Developing new data can be credited under Activity 410 (Flood Hazard Mapping).
- Review how to prepare a floodplain management plan, following the 10-step process described in Activity 510 (Floodplain Management Planning). If you have developed a multi-hazard mitigation plan, Activity 510 can still assist you in developing a more comprehensive plan for flood damage reduction.
- To develop an overall public information program, see the section on the Program for Public Information in Activity 330 (Outreach Projects).

**If you want to improve a specific aspect of your existing floodplain management efforts**, the CRS has 19 credited activities and additional sections and appendices that provide supplementary guidance and references. Here is a guide to what they cover.
