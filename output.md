Activities not directly recognized by the Community Rating System
Note that some activities are not directly recognized by the program for one of three reasons:
▪

They do not directly affect buildings that can be insured under the NFIP (e.g., uninsurable
items such as streets and land value);

▪

They are recognized by other aspects of the flood insurance rating program (e.g., flood
control projects that result in revised FIRMs reduce flood insurance premiums in protected
areas); or

▪

The impact of an activity cannot be measured (e.g., preserving floodplains for aesthetic
reasons).

Credit criteria may change over time as experience is gained in implementing, observing, and
measuring the activities and as new concepts in floodplain management come into common
practice. As innovations arise, they will be considered for recognition.

114 The Community’s Role
114.a. COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION
Community participation in the CRS is voluntary. Any community in full compliance with the rules and
regulations of the NFIP may apply for a classification better than Class 10. A community may apply to
participate in the Community Rating System at any time.
The application procedures are simple: the community submits a letter of interest and shows that it
is implementing activities that would receive at least 500 credit points. The documents go to the
Contractor for that community. The Regional Office of the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) must approve the submittal to ensure that the community is in full compliance with the
minimum floodplain management criteria of the NFIP. See also Section 212.
Upon receiving FEMA approval, a community verification visit is scheduled by the Contractor. At this
verification visit, the Contractor reviews all of the community’s activities that may deserve credit,
even those not in the community’s submittal. All credit is verified according to the credit criteria in
the “Coordinator’s Manual” in effect at the time of the visit. The verification process is discussed in
Activity 230.
After the verification visit, the Contractor submits its findings to FEMA. FEMA sets the credit to be
granted and notifies the community, the state, insurance companies, and other appropriate parties.
The classification is effective on either April 1 or October 1, whichever comes first, after the
community’s activities are verified.
Each year the community must recertify that it is continuing to perform the activities for which it is
receiving credit. Recertification is an annual activity that includes progress reports for certain
